# Project Status — read this first in a new session

Updated: 2026-07-25 (build-out session 3, wave 3). This is the handoff snapshot; BUGS.md is
the canonical defect tracker, FIX_POLICY.md the patching rules, WORKFLOW.md the
dev/test/release process, RESEARCH.md the lead catalog (incl. ChatGPT dossier
cross-check), MOD_DESCRIPTION.md the player-facing mod-page draft (update its fix
list in the same commit that implements a fix; only `tested` fixes ship in the
final text), TESTING.md the force-the-bug test plan, CHEATS_INVENTORY.md the
shipped cheat/debug surface the tests drive.

## What this project is

"Community Fix Pack" — a runtime-Lua bug-fix mod for Surviving Mars: Relaunched
(game dir `A:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Project Spark`, Haemimont Sol engine,
NOT Unreal; full gameplay source shipped in `<game>\ModTools\Src`). No game files
are modified; planned community release after user testing. Dev repo:
`C:\Dev\SMR-BugFixPack` (git). Installed via junction at
`%AppData%\Surviving Mars Relaunched\Mods\SMR-BugFixPack`.

Companion **Test Kit** mod (never shipped): `C:\Dev\SMR-BugFixPack-TestKit` (git).
`SMRTest.RunAll()` runs one probe per fix and prints PASS/FAIL/SKIP; run it with
the fix pack disabled (expect FAILs) and enabled (expect PASSes). It also enables
the Lua console at load and carries observability loggers and state reports.

## Discovery: COMPLETE

- 73 tracked findings (~85 distinct defects) verified against the CURRENT
  (post-1.0.7) shipped source, each with file:line evidence + fix sketch in BUGS.md.
- 1 design-change verdict (D01 rocket auto-refuel/rare-metals — plan opt-in module).
- 2 candidates needing runtime checks (C01 BreakthroughOrder, C02 asteroid cave-ins).
- 3 critical UNTRACED leads (RESEARCH.md): 90%-breathable-atmosphere freeze,
  Last War mystery import lock at 54%, game-stops-saving. Plus smaller new leads
  from the ChatGPT dossier cross-check (top of RESEARCH.md).

## Implementation: 39 fixes DONE (30 probe-verified in-game 2026-07-25; the 9 wave-3 fixes have probes but NO A/B run yet)

Wave 1 (earlier session): F01 cave-ins/NoDisasters, F02 meteor frequency,
F03* upgrade-modifier leak, F04 night shift, F05 milestone crash, F07+F15* wisp
power/rewards, F08 tourist applicants, F10 faction funding, F64 trains-to-void.

Wave 2 (earlier session, in queue order): F67 lander empty launch, F68 lander cargo
ratchet, F69 lander return fuel, F73 shelter reflex, F45 broken-track salvage,
F44 track salvage wipe, F30 lake entombment, F37 ghost farm oxygen, F50 rocket
drone churn, F51 shuttle transport cache, F52* vacuum walks, F53 arrival deaths,
F55* drone unreachable-forever, F58* stale reservations, F61 home-dome migration
gate, F06 crystal mystery hang, F09 tourist satisfaction, F11 train platform
wedge, F12 low-storage warning, F13 Command Center numbers, F14 Domes Overview
highlight.
(* = partial; the remaining half is recorded on the BUGS.md entry.)

Wave 3 (this session, in queue order): F46 train cargo dumping, F36 university
overtraining, F38 destroyed tunnels, F39 second artificial sun, F40 Dust Sickness on
Biorobots, F17 Dust Sickness randomization, F41 Gene Forging, F16 Mirror Sphere site,
F70* Edit Payload template refill.
(* = partial; the remaining half is recorded on the BUGS.md entry.)

**Wave-3 fixes have not been run in-game at all.** Each ships with a probe in the Test
Kit's new `Code/30_Probes_Wave3.lua` (registered in its metadata), but no RunAll A/B pair
has been executed since wave 2. That pair is the first thing the next QA leg should do.

Three wave-3 fixes add their own `OnMsg.LoadGame` repair pass: F38 (close destroyed
tunnels left open in pathfinding), F39 (reconnect solar panels to a sun in range), F40
(clear Dust Sickness from already-infected Biorobots). F70 introduces the pack's first
persisted member, `transporter.SMRFixPack_payload_set` (a single boolean, absence = the
pre-fix behaviour, so removing the mod is still safe).

Six fixes carry a one-shot `OnMsg.LoadGame` / `OnMsg.NewDay` repair pass for state
already baked into savegames: F02 (thread restart), F45 (stamp repair sites),
F37 (remove phantom farm oxygen), F58 (release stale reservations), F06 (restart
the crystal repeater), plus F55's expiry which self-heals. The consolidated
`Code/90_SaveSanitizer.lua` module is still a later phase — the remaining sweeps
it was to collect are F03 (leaked modifiers), F35 (turbine buff) and F48
(connectors).

## QA session snapshot (Fable, 2026-07-25) — kept for the audit record

**NOTE — everything actionable below is RESOLVED:** the F53 and F12 reworks
LANDED (commits aa980e7 / 40d5a73) and survived the final A/B pair; the autorun
harness IS committed (TestKit); the RunAll pair HAS run clean — see the FINAL
A/B section above. Still open from this section: F68 capacity-cap in-game check,
F44 curve-ended track visual check, wave-1 heading tags.

- BUGS.md index was stale (16 wave-2 rows said `todo` despite tagged headings) —
  synced in commit 0ef4e7c. README/MOD_DESCRIPTION verified complete. Follow-up:
  wave-1 detail headings (F04/05/07/08/10/15/64) lack the `[fixed]` tag.
- Nothing was marked `blocked` in the build session. F55's "open-air entrance half
  not actionable" verdict was re-verified and is CORRECT (CalcOpenAirSkin only
  empties skin[2] configurable attaches; Dome_Entrance is entity-spot auto-attach
  data, Dome.lua:404 — not patchable from Lua). F55 drone half diffs clean.
- Spot-audit of 6 fixes (F61, F12, F44, F53, F68, F73) — full reports in the
  session transcript; summary:
  * **F53 CRITICAL — rework before release.** The `not IsInWalkingDist` gate in
    Fix_ArrivalDeaths.lua is always true for cross-map elevator destinations
    (IsInWalkingDistDome returns false when maps differ, Dome.lua:248-251), so
    every legitimate elevator arrival triggers the re-choose; the re-choose
    discards ChooseDome's elevator return and never clears stale
    self.emigration_elevator → TransportByFoot rides the stale elevator, fails
    the map-slot check (Colonist.lua:2731) → SetCommand("Abandoned"). Repair:
    skip the gate when ValidateBuilding(self.emigration_elevator) routes to
    dome; on re-choice take BOTH returns and assign emigration_elevator.
  * **F12 MODERATE — rework.** Post-wrapper leaves shipped dead branch removing
    the notification hourly, wrapper re-adds → destroy/recreate churn + FX replay
    every game hour while active; dismiss/suppression semantics differ. Docs
    prescribe full replacement — do that instead.
  * **F68 MODERATE — verify in-game.** The requested-floor (belt-and-braces
    block) doesn't debit hold capacity: with multiple exports, an alphabetically
    earlier resource's request can exceed remaining capacity → status stuck
    "loading", automode rocket sits on pad (departure gate needs "ready").
    Consider capping the floor against remaining capacity.
  * **F61 CLEAN**, **F44 CLEAN** (in-game check: curve-ended remainder track
    visuals; F45-comparator fold-in disclosed), **F73 CLEAN** (note:
    IsSuitable is AutoResolveMethods "and"-combined with Residence.IsSuitable —
    correct today, document it; partial-application isn't reported in the log).
  * Recurring minor: header/BUGS line-number drift (off-by-ones); apply()
    self-checks don't pre-check every runtime symbol.
- AccountStorage research (for the RunAll pair): enabled mods live in
  AccountStorage.LoadMods (plain array of metadata.lua `id` strings), persisted
  in `%AppData%\Surviving Mars Relaunched\<SteamID64>\account.dat` — an
  in-memory HPK (magic BPUL) containing `account.lua`, AES-encrypted+HMAC with
  key SHA256(GetAppId()..config.ProjectKey), compressed. BUT the loader is
  best-effort: a plaintext `return {...}` account.lua inside the container still
  loads (lib.lua:2187-2216). Edit only with the game closed; ids for missing/
  too-old mods are auto-stripped at menu (Mod.lua:2033-2059). Escape hatch:
  `AccountStorage.LoadAllMods = true` loads every discovered mod, bypassing the
  list. Unpacked mods in Mods\ need metadata.lua with `id` + `lua_revision` ≥
  350453. No Paradox cloud sync of account.dat (CloudSavesAllowed() = false).
- RunAll before/after pair NOT run: the Relaunched profile has never been created
  (%AppData%\Surviving Mars Relaunched\ has only Mods; no saves/logs/AccountStorage;
  no Steam userdata for appid 3215050) and mods can't be enabled until first launch.
  TestKit is now junctioned next to the fix pack. An opt-in autorun harness
  (TestKit Code\95_AutoRun.lua: flag-file gated, auto new game via
  NewGame/InitNewGameMissionParams/LoadLastNewGameSettings + fill g_CurrentMapParams
  + GenerateCurrentRandomMap, then RunAll with [SMRAUTO] markers, watchdog, quit())
  was being built when the session ended — it is NOT committed; check the TestKit
  repo before relying on it. Retail exe ignores -save/-map (goldmaster-gated,
  autorun.lua:126-144); Mars.exe launches directly, no external Paradox launcher.

## Next up — wave-3 queue, resume here

The wave-3 leg stopped after F70. Remaining, in order:

1. **F71** auto-export allocates capacity alphabetically. Careful: the target
   (`CreateAutoCargoRequest`, `UniversalRocket.lua:1736-1758`) is already replaced by
   wave 2's `Fix_LanderCargoRatchet.lua` — F71 must be folded into that file's copy or
   layered on top of it, not written as a second independent replacement.
2. **F72** "No available Asteroid Landers" while one sits on the pad
   (`PlanetaryView.lua:433-444`, `PlanetUI.lua:1623-1651`).
3. **F54** switched-off shuttle hubs count as transport available.
4. **F59/F60/F62/F63** housing/service reach bundle.
5. **F32** notification suppression (data patch on three NotificationPresets).
6. **F33/F34** landscape nil guards.
7. **`Code/90_SaveSanitizer.lua`** — the consolidated savegame sweeps: **F35**
   (turbine buff; skipped in step 1 deliberately because it is a pure LoadGame sweep
   with no live half), **F03** (leaked upgrade modifiers), **F48** (station connectors).
8. **D01** opt-in classic-rockets module.
9. Test Kit side-task: give the F51 shuttle-cache probe a scenario strict enough to
   discriminate (it PASSes even unfixed on a fresh colony).
10. Also queued from F70: the legacy `LanderRocketCargoRequest:RetrieveRequests`
    one-word guard correction — see the F70 entry in BUGS.md.

## Key technical facts (hard-won, do not re-derive)

- **Mod code loads BEFORE the classes are built.** `autorun.lua:423` calls
  `ModsLoadCode()`; classes are assembled later in `OnMsg.Autorun`
  (`CommonLua\Core\classes.lua:980`). So at apply() time a class global is still
  its **classdef**, exposing only members the class declares ITSELF — an inherited
  method reads as nil. Two consequences:
  * `function Building:X() ... end` in a fix DOES propagate to every subclass
    (the classdef is what gets flattened later) — this is why class-method
    replacement works at all;
  * an apply() self-check must look for the method on its **declaring** class.
    Checking `Station.OnDemolish` (declared on Building), or
    `UniversalRocketBase.IsAutoModeEnabled` (declared on the AutoMode mixin),
    finds nil and silently deactivates the fix. F64 shipped broken this way and
    was corrected this session.
- `g_Consts` is a **GameVar** (`Lua\Modifiers.lua:427`) and does not exist while
  mods load — read it inside the patched function, never in apply(). `const` IS
  populated at that point.
- Engine Lua tolerates `#nil`/`next(nil)`/`ipairs(false)` (verified from working
  code paths) but NOT boolean relational compares — don't report/fix nil-iteration
  as crashes. `/` truncates (integer division); that is what makes F12's
  `a*24/v*24` unsatisfiable.
- **Mods run in a sandbox (LuaModEnv) on ALL platforms**, including unpacked dev
  mods (Mod.lua:1730/:1750; blacklist at :1267-1428). Key facts: `debug`, `io`,
  `package`, `lfs`, all `Async*` file ops, load/dofile/require are BLACKLISTED;
  `os` is `{time}` only; `setmetatable` is available (:1408 commented out);
  `rawget` is a safe wrapper that reaches real `_G` for non-blacklisted names —
  the pack's `rawget(_G, "X")` pattern works; `_G` maps to the env, but NEW
  globals created at load are rawset into the REAL `_G` (:1557-1563), so
  `SMRFixPack`/`SMRTest` are cross-mod and console visible; `Msg`/`OnMsg` are
  filtered only for persist/debug messages. The fix pack Code/ uses no
  blacklisted API (verified) — sandbox- and console-clean.
- **`error()` and `assert()` do NOT unwind mod code — they report and execution
  continues** with the next statement (LuaExports.lua:567 "asserts pop instead of
  being printed out"). Never use them for control flow; `pcall` still catches
  genuine runtime errors. Cost us four bogus FAILs and ten ERRORs in the first
  A/B pair (see the diagnosis section).
- **`rawset(_G, k, v)` from mod code writes only into the mod's own env table**
  (`_G` IS that table, Mod.lua:1603; `rawset` is the real rawset, only `rawget`
  is replaced at :1606). To write a global the game can see, assign it —
  `_G[k] = v` goes through `ModEnvMeta.__newindex` (:1557-1563) into the real
  `_G`. `rawget(_G, "X")` for READS is fine (safe_rawget falls through, :1577).
- **CORRECTION of an earlier "fact": `debug.getinfo` is NOT available in mod
  code** (debug is blacklisted). The Test Kit's install probes
  (00_TestCore.lua:37) break under the sandbox; repair in progress — bridge
  real `debug` via a console-exec path or SKIP install probes with a
  `SMRTest.debug = debug` console instruction. `GetStaticMsgNames()` (F06 probe)
  is a real global and still fine.
- Patch points that work: `PeriodicRepeatInfo[name]` slots (THREAD/SLEEP/FUNC/COND
  = 1..4, CommonLua\Core\lib.lua:1538+), `GlobalGameTimeThreadFuncs[name]` +
  `RestartGlobalGameTimeThread(name)` on LoadGame (Lua\Config\_fixup.lua),
  class-method replacement, chained wrappers, `OnMsg.*` additive handlers,
  preset/data patches at ClassesPostprocess.
- A post-wrapper on a **command** method (anything ending in `SetCommand`) never
  runs — `DoSetCommand` kills the calling thread. `Colonist:Idle` must be
  pre-wrapped (F73).
- Mod registry: every fix goes through `SMRFixPack.Register(id, {title, apply})`
  (Code/00_Core.lua); apply self-checks the target and returns a reason string to
  deactivate gracefully; `SMRFixPack_Disabled` = user veto; `SMRFixPack.ListFixes()`
  console status.
- All line numbers reference `ModTools\Src`; the game executes `Packs\Lua.fpk`
  (slightly newer date) — runtime self-checks in apply() are the guard.
  `GatherTransportableResources` (`ResourceTracking.lua:216`) is *called* but
  defined nowhere in Src — an engine export or an fpk-only function. F12's fix
  checks for it at apply time.
- Sample mod format in `<game>\ModTools\Samples\Mods`; docs in `ModTools\Docs\index.md.html`.

## FINAL A/B RunAll pair (repaired TestKit) — CLEAN SWEEP (2026-07-25)

Re-run after the TestKit repairs (WithGlobals now writes real globals; sentinel
SKIPs; probe fixes). Logs: Mars.exe-20260725-14.17.33 (baseline) / -14.20.37
(fixed). **19/19 discriminating probes flipped FAIL→PASS; zero FAILs remain;
all 30 fixes `applied`.** Probe-verified fixes: F03, F04, F07, F08, F09, F11,
F13, F14, F15, F50, F51*, F52, F55, F58, F61, F67, F68, F69, F73, F06.
Not discriminated on a virgin colony: F10 (funding table non-nil → PASS both),
F51 probe PASSed both runs (cache re-evaluated even unfixed in this synthetic
scenario — probe may need a stricter setup). 10 [install] probes SKIP on retail
(sandbox); run the pair once under MarsDebug.exe for that coverage. F73's Idle
wrapper half also needs the debug-exe run (PASS was the IsSuitable half).
`tested` status remains reserved for scenario/manual verification per
TESTING.md — probe-verified ≠ full in-game scenario pass, but the wiring and
regression harness are now proven.

## Superseded: first pair (buggy TestKit) — kept for the record

Unattended harness works end-to-end (TestKit 95_AutoRun, `-smrautorun` via Steam
relaunch; Steam DRM blocks direct Mars.exe launch — bootstrap exits in 28ms).
Baseline = fix pack metadata `code` emptied; B = full pack. **All 30 fixes
report `applied`** (no inactive/error self-checks). Results:
- **FAIL→PASS (10):** UpgradeModifierLeak, TouristApplicants, LanderEmptyLaunch,
  LanderReturnFuel, RocketDroneChurn, StaleReservations, CrystalMysteryHang,
  TouristSatisfaction, TrainPlatformWedge, CommandCenterNumbers.
- **Applied but probe still FAILs (4) — diagnose fix-vs-probe:** WispPower (nil
  power units both runs), LanderCargoRatchet (request still drops to 0 with
  cargo aboard), HomeDomeMigrationGate (same fail text both runs),
  DomeOverviewHighlight (baseline "renders as 0", B "renders as table:0x…" —
  behavior changed, probe may mis-parse a T() value).
- **Probe/tooling casualties:** 10 [install] probes ERROR both runs — the
  no-introspection sentinel itself crashes (00_TestCore.lua:76 indexes nil
  'lib'); ShelterReflex ERROR in B (same crash via its wrapper check);
  VacuumWalks SKIP in B ("unexpected route value: unset").
- **Non-discriminating on a virgin colony:** FactionFundingCheck PASS both
  (funding table not nil on fresh game); NightShiftWork/WispResearch/
  ShuttleTransportCache/DroneUnreachableForever SKIP both (need colonists/
  mystery/shuttle state).
- Full logs: %AppData%\Surviving Mars Relaunched\logs\Mars.exe-20260725-13.56.49
  (baseline) and -13.58.35 (fixed).
- For [install] coverage: run the pair under MarsDebug.exe (console/asserts
  build un-sandboxes introspection; auto-bridge then fires).

### Diagnosis of the four "applied but still FAIL" probes — ALL FOUR FIXES ARE SOUND

Every one of the four was a Test Kit defect; **no fix pack code changed**. Two
engine facts (both now recorded in the Test Kit sources) explain all of them plus
the tooling casualties:

1. **`error()` does not unwind mod code.** It REPORTS (the `[LUA ERROR]` block
   with stack + locals) and execution continues with the next statement — the
   same treatment `assert` gets ("asserts pop instead of being printed out",
   LuaExports.lua:567). So `SourceOf`'s sentinel printed a stack and then ran the
   line it was guarding (00_TestCore.lua:76 → ERROR, not SKIP), and
   `WithGlobals`' `if not ok then error(res, 0) end` swallowed every error raised
   inside a probe's driven code — the probe carried on with a nil result and
   reported FAIL. Never use `error()` for control flow in mod code.
2. **`rawset(_G, k, v)` from mod code writes nothing the game can see.** In the
   sandbox `_G` IS the mod's own env table (Mod.lua:1603) and `rawset` is the
   real rawset (only `rawget` is replaced, :1606), so the Test Kit's fake globals
   were shadows in the Test Kit's env — invisible to shipped code (real `_G`) and
   to the fix pack (its own env). Plain assignment `_G[k] = v` goes through
   `ModEnvMeta.__newindex` (:1557-1563), which rawsets the REAL `_G`; that is the
   write a probe needs. **Every `WithGlobals` probe in the pair was therefore
   driving the real globals**, which is why the numbers looked absurd.

Per item, with the evidence that settled it:
- **WispPower (F07) — probe.** The fake `MainCity.labels.LightTrap` was invisible,
  so `SetLightTrapMode` iterated the live (empty) label and never called
  `el_prod_modifier:Change` → `granted` stayed nil in BOTH runs. The `* 1000` fix
  (Fix_WispRewards.lua:49) matches the sibling call sites exactly.
- **LanderCargoRatchet (F68) — probe.** The fixed method ran; the fake
  `GetTotalCargoAvailable` was invisible, so the real one crashed on the
  synthetic city (`[LUA ERROR] Lua/ResourceOverview.lua:30: attempt to call a nil
  value (method 'GetMap')`, raised from WithGlobals) and the swallowed error left
  `captured` nil → "request dropped to 0". The requested-floor block is intact
  and would have engaged (`is_on_automode_target_loc` true, `export_above.Metals`
  set, 300k aboard). The separate audit finding stands and is NOT this:
  the floor still does not debit hold capacity — verify in-game with multiple
  exports.
- **HomeDomeMigrationGate (F61) — probe.** Proof the fix worked: the fake global
  `ChooseWorkplace` was invisible, so the *real* one ran on the synthetic
  colonist and crashed (`Lua/Buildings/Workplace.lua:1095: attempt to index a nil
  value (local 'traits')`) — which it can only have been handed after
  `GetCommutableWorkplaces` produced the connected list, i.e. after the
  `accept_colonists` gate was gone. No fifth ungated call path is involved.
- **DomeOverviewHighlight (F14) — probe.** The fix is right and the shipped UI
  wants exactly what it now passes: a T value is a TABLE in this engine
  (`Untranslated(s)` → `T{s, untranslated = true}`, localization.lua:343) and the
  shipped sibling paths hand the same kind of table to the same `SetText`
  (ColonyControlCenter.lua:502-507). The probe `tostring()`ed it and saw
  `table: 0x…`; it now reads the literal out of the T.
- **VacuumWalks (F52) — probe** (same root cause; the fixed run's "unset" meant
  `SetCommand` was never reached because the real `GetDomesPassagePath` answered).

Test Kit repairs (repo `C:\Dev\SMR-BugFixPack-TestKit`): deferred-verdict
mechanism replacing the raise (657b668), WithGlobals write-through (413d87c),
F73 partial PASS (57139f5), F14 T reader (3f1abb4), F52 message (77fdb72),
AutoRun `wait_for` timeout (d2636b7), Meteors logger global swap (42d9f43).
**The A/B pair must be re-run** — with the fakes finally visible, several probes
that "passed" or SKIPped were not testing what they claimed.

## Waiting on the user

1. DONE 2026-07-25 — both mods enabled, automated A/B RunAll pair ran clean
   (30/30 applied, 19/19 FAIL→PASS). Remaining variant: one pair under
   MarsDebug.exe (debugging launch option) for [install]-probe + F73-wrapper
   coverage — fully automated, just needs the two Steam "Continue" clicks.
2. Author name/handle for metadata.lua (placeholder TBD_SET_BEFORE_RELEASE), in
   both mods.
3. For the save-failure lead: logs from `%AppData%\Surviving Mars Relaunched\logs`
   and Ctrl+F1 reports from affected players would pin it.
4. An in-game observation for F55: do drones still enter a dome after the roof is
   opened? The Lua half of that report turned out not to be actionable (see the
   F55 entry) — only play can tell us whether the entity data is at fault.
5. Manual playtest per `docs/PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md` (31 tests — PT-23..PT-31 are the
   new wave-3 group 6; no third-party mods;
   covers what scripts can't: feel, visuals, UI, long-running behavior). Results
   reported back flip each covered fix's BUGS.md status to `tested` — see that
   file's "Reporting protocol" section for the exact follow-up workflow.

## Save-rescue expectations (for release messaging + sanitizer design)

~60% of fixes help broken saves IMMEDIATELY (behavioral code re-evaluated every
tick/cycle: drones, colonists, schedulers — F02 pattern of thread-restart on
LoadGame where needed). ~25% need active repair; six of those passes now ship
(see above), the rest are queued for the sanitizer module (F03 leaked modifiers,
F35 turbine buff, F48 connectors). ~15% is irreversible history (dead colonists,
lost expeditions; F64 voided trains have no recorded count — heuristic
compensation option at best, and document the vanilla train re-purchase at
stations, Station.lua:573-611). Save rescue is the headline differentiator vs
official patches ("new games only") — lead with it.

## Distribution facts (researched 2026-07-25, source-verified)

- BOTH Steam Workshop AND Paradox Mods are supported; the in-game Mod Editor has
  upload buttons for each (ModEditor.lua:78/:115). Steam Workshop reaches PC
  only; **Paradox Mods is the only channel that reaches Xbox/PS5** — platform
  fan-out is automatic on the backend, no platform fields, no modder-side
  signing (PS5 signatures are created client-side at install, Mod.lua:49-95).
  Console loads packed Lua code mods fine; no engine restriction found.
- PDX upload hard-requires: title, short_description (≤200 chars), description,
  preview image, lua_revision; last_changes on every update; ≤10 tags
  (ParadoxMods.lua:13-54, Mod.lua:410). GitHub repo link goes in metadata
  `external_links` — "github" is a supported LinkType shown on the PDX portal
  (Mod.lua:180-201). Default ignore_files already excludes *.git/*.
- Public repo: github.com/catt144/SMR-CommunityFixPack (main). Commit identity
  is the GitHub noreply address — never commit with a real email again.
- Achievements are disabled while any mod is active (ModManager.lua:78) —
  mention in the mod description.

## Release checklist (when fixes are tested)

Real author + version bump in metadata.lua; player-facing fix list in README +
mod description; upload via in-game Mod Editor (check docs/.git exclusion; the
Test Kit must NOT be uploaded); credit ChoGGi (Fix Bugs) + LukeH (Martian
Express) as prior art; keep per-fix disable instructions in the description.
