<!-- /RULES -->

This ledger tracks every player-facing tree change since the last upload.
`docs/agent/prompts/perma/release_prompt.md` derives `last_changes`, fix-list
rows and the store-card count from it, then appends Pending entries to
`docs/archive/RELEASE_HISTORY.md` after upload. `docs/agent/support/RELEASE_SURFACES.md` defines which changes
have a player surface.

**Live tree version:** `metadata.lua` `version` — read it, never hand-set (editor/version rail (`docs/agent/prompts/perma/release_prompt.md` § Release rails)).
**Live count word:** whatever `metadata.lua`'s `description` currently says
(`grep -oE '[A-Z][a-z]+(-[a-z]+)? repairs' metadata.lua` — one hit; zero is a FAIL). Each pending fix that has a
player surface bumps it by one on release.

## Pending — goes out with the next upload

## Last released

**v13** (2026-09-18). Its entry and every earlier release are in
`docs/archive/RELEASE_HISTORY.md`, oldest first.
