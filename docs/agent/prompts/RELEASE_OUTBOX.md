# Release outbox — player-facing changes staged for the NEXT upload

**What this is.** A running ledger of every change that has landed in the tree
**since the last upload** and must appear on a player surface when the next
version ships. It is the single answer to "what is in the next release?" — the
`last_changes` change note, the new fix-list rows, and the store-card count word
all come from here. `RELEASE.md` reads it, applies every entry to the surfaces,
and **clears it** (moves the entries to *Released* below) once the upload is done.

**Live tree version:** `metadata.lua` `version` — read it, never hand-set (H-02).
**Live count word:** whatever `metadata.lua`'s `description` currently says
(`grep -o 'Eighty[a-z-]* repairs' metadata.lua`). Each pending fix that has a
player surface bumps it by one on release.

## How to use it
- **When a player-facing fix lands** (added, retired, or materially re-scoped —
  the `PUBLIC_SURFACE_SWEEP.md` §0.4 test): append a `### Pending` entry below,
  filled in. A pack-internal fix that never shipped broken (the F107 case) gets
  **no entry** — it has no player surface.
- **When the owner is ready to upload:** run `RELEASE.md`. It consumes every
  `### Pending` entry, then rewrites this file with those entries moved under
  *Released in vN* and the *Pending* section empty.
- ⛔ Never delete a pending entry by hand — that silently drops a fix from the
  change note. Retire one only through a release (it moves to *Released*) or by
  recording explicitly why it was withdrawn.

## Pending — goes out with the next upload

*(empty — cleared by RELEASE.md on the v5 upload, 2026-08-30.)*

## Released — history, newest first (cleared here by RELEASE.md)

### Released in v5 (2026-08-30)
- **F110 · `Fix_JumboCaveReinforcementWedge`** — a Jumbo Cave mystery could get
  stuck forever clearing waste rock the drones could not reach, so the
  Reinforcement never built and the mystery never completed. Fix-list row in
  *Story & mysteries*; headliner bullet added; count word Eighty-one → Eighty-two;
  `last_changes` rewritten as v5's change note. Not a judgment call.

*(The v4 release and earlier predate this ledger.)*
